NAME
    Test::Httpd::Apache2 - Apache2 runner for tests

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Httpd::Apache2;

        my $httpd = Test::Httpd::Apache2->new(
            custom_conf => << 'EOT',
        DocumentRoot "htdocs"
        EOT
        );

        # do whatever you want
        my $url = "http://" . $httpd->listen . "/";
        ...

DESCRIPTION
    The module automatically setups an instance of Apache2 httpd server and
    destroys it when the perl script exits.

FUNCTIONS
  new
    Creates and runs the httpd server. Httpd is terminated when the returned
    object is DESTROYed. The function accepts following arguments, which can
    also be read and/or be set through the accessors of the same name.

   listen
    The address to which the httpd binds to. Corresponds to the "Listen"
    configuration directive of Apache. The default value is
    "127.0.0.1:<whatever_port_that_was_unused>".

   server_root
    The "ServerRoot" runtime directive. Set to current working directory if
    omitted.

   custom_conf
    Application-specific configuration passed that will be written to the
    configuration file of Apache. Default is none.

   required_modules
    An arrayref to specify the required apache modules. If any module are
    specified, "Test::Httpd::Apache2" will check the list of
    statically-compiled-in and dynamically-aviable modules and load the
    necessary modules automatically. Module names should be specified
    excluding the "mod_" prefix and ".so" suffix. For example,
    "auth_basic_module" should be specified as "auth_basic". Default is an
    empty arrayref.

   search_paths
    Paths to look for the httpd server in addition to the PATH environment
    variable. The default is: /usr/sbin, /usr/local/sbin,
    /usr/local/apache/bin.

   pid
    the read-only accessor returns pid of the httpd server or undef if it is
    not running

  start
    the instance method starts the httpd server

  stop
    the instance method stops the httpd server
